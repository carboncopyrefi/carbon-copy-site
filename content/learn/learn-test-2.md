In addition, Tether also clarified that its exposure to Chinese commercial papers was liquid and all of the issuers were stable. The company also said that the papers were being used by some of the world’s biggest investment managers. “The Chinese banking-related commercial paper at issue was rated A1 or better,” they added.
