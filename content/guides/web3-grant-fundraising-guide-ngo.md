This guide is tailored specifically for Nigerian NGOs exploring Web3 funding options as an additional source of funding. It includes instructions for setting up a Web3 wallet, a cryptocurrency exchange account, and Web3 fundraising platform accounts, along with tips for finding funding opportunities. I've tried to keep it concise to help you quickly find the necessary information.

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
This guide is not an exhaustive resource on Web3 funding or grants, nor does it guarantee funding.
</div>

## Before We Get Started

There are some important things you need to know and have before starting your Web3 grant fundraising journey:

### Cryptocurrency basics

<ul>
<li>Cryptocurrency is digital money transacted without the control of the bank or government.

::GuideModal{id="gs-crypto-1" title="Cryptocurrency is digital money transacted without the control of the bank or government" body="It gained mainstream adoption because many believe that banks and governments are naturally corrupt and unreliable. This corruption-resistant tech has gained traction in philanthropy as a quick and borderless crowdfunding tool for non-profits."}
::
</li>

<li>Cryptocurrencies are either stable or volatile.

::GuideModal{id="gs-crypto-2" title="Cryptocurrencies are either stable or volatile." body="Stable cryptocurrencies (stablecoins) do not fluctuate with market conditions because they are pegged to a traditional currency like the US dollar. Volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can change significantly based on market conditions."}
::
</li>

<li>A Web3 wallet is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies.

::GuideModal{id="gs-crypto-3" title="A Web3 wallet, is a digital tool that allows you to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies" body="Ownership is determined by whoever holds the wallet's recovery phrase, as it authorises outgoing transactions. Anyone who gets your recovery phrase can steal all your crypto by using it in any wallet app. Knowing how to use a crypto wallet to access and manage crowdfunded/grant crypto assets is essential."}
::
</li>

</ul>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  For a more detailed explanation of cryptocurrencies, I recommend this article by <a href="https://www.coursera.org/articles/how-does-cryptocurrency-work" target="_blank">Coursera</a>.
</div>

### Potential risks

<ul>
<li>Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, meaning that mistakes can lead to permanent losses.

::GuideModal{id="gs-risks-1" title="Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, meaning that mistakes can lead to permanent losses" body="Guard your recovery phrase with all vigilance because losing access to it means losing access to your crypto assets. Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets are frequent targets for hackers, so if your security measures are inadequate, it can lead to substantial financial losses."}

</li>

<li>The cryptocurrency space is rife with scams. 

::GuideModal{id="gs-risks-2" title="The cryptocurrency space is rife with scams" body="You can lose your crypto assets because you clicked an unsuspecting link or interacted with a particular protocol. Unlike traditional financial systems, there is usually no insurance or protection against such losses with cryptocurrencies."}

</li>

<li>The technical nature of cryptocurrencies poses challenges for new users.

::GuideModal{id="gs-risks-3" title="The technical nature of cryptocurrencies poses challenges, especially for new users" body="The complexity of sending assets across networks and addresses can lead to asset loss."}

</li>
</ul>

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
  This guide was created with these risks in mind. You’ll find detailed steps to avoid losing money from these risks as you go through it.
</div>

### Prerequisites

To get the most out of this guide, I recommend having these three things ready before proceeding:

<ul>
<li>Proper branding

::GuideModal{id="prereq-1" title="Proper branding" body="A strong brand identity helps your NGO stand out. This includes a well-designed logo, clearly articulated vision and mission statements, a compelling slogan or tagline, and unique imagery."}

</li>

<li>Social media accounts for your NGO

::GuideModal{id="prereq-2" title="Social media accounts for your NGO" body="Sharing stories, images, and videos of your NGO's activities on social media builds its authenticity and increases its engagement with a wider audience."}

</li>

<li>A bank account 

::GuideModal{id="prereq-3" title="A bank account" body="Despite the fact that cryptocurrency works outside of the banking system, you will need a bank account and a government-issued ID to use some of the platforms discussed in this guide."}

</li>
</ul>

## Step 1 - Setting up a Web3 wallet and exchange account

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    <p><strong>In this step, you’ll do two things:</strong></p>
    <ol class="m-0">
    <li>Create a Web3 wallet</li>
    <li class="mb-0">Create an account with a cryptocurrency exchange</li>
    </ol>
</div>

### Creating a Web3 wallet

A Web3 wallet is your access point to Web3 fundraising for your NGO. We'll be using <a href="https://rainbow.me/" target="_blank">Rainbow wallet</a> to set one up.

<ol>

<li>Download the app on a <a href="https://rnbwapp.com/e/mobile" target="_blank">mobile device</a> or <a href="https://rainbow.me/download" target="_blank">computer</a>.

<div class="alert alert-warning fs-6" role="alert">
  This guide is optimised for mobile phones, however the steps will still work on your computer. 
</div>

 </li>

 <li>Open the app and click "Create a new wallet."
    
::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-how-to-set-up-a-web3-wallet-1.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Click "Reveal your recovery phrase".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-how-to-set-up-a-web3-wallet-2.jpg"}
::

<div class="alert alert-warning fs-6" role="alert">
  For security reasons, ensure no one else is around before you reveal the phrase.
</div>

</li>

<li>Write down on paper in the order and numbering displayed, and store it in a safe place. Select "I’ve saved these words".    

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-how-to-set-up-a-web3-wallet-3.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Verify the phrase you wrote down.

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-how-to-set-up-a-web3-wallet-4.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Create your password. Once the password shows Excellent, select "Set password".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-how-to-set-up-a-web3-wallet-5.jpg"}
::

<div class="alert alert-warning fs-6" role="alert">
  Avoid easy-to-guess passwords that you are able to remember, or consider a password manager like <a href="https://bitwarden.com" target="_blank">BitWarden</a> for secure passwords that you don't need to remember.
</div>

</li>

<li>And voila! You have successfully created your Web3 wallet. 🎉

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-how-to-set-up-a-web3-wallet-6.jpg"}
::

</li>

</ol>

### Setting up an exchange account

An exchange account allows you to swap cryptocurrency for fiat and vice versa. We'll be using Bitget to set one up.

<ol>

<li>Bitget only works on mobile, so visit your favourite app store to download it.</li>

<li>Open the app and tap "Continue".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-setting-up-a-crypto-exchange-account-1.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Tap "Get Started".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-setting-up-a-crypto-exchange-account-2.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Sign up with your email or mobile number and create a password.

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-setting-up-a-crypto-exchange-account-3.jpg"}
::

<div class="alert alert-warning fs-6" role="alert">
    Avoid easy-to-guess passwords that you are able to remember, or consider a password manager like <a href="https://bitwarden.com" target="_blank">BitWarden</a> for secure passwords that you don't need to remember.
</div>

</li>

<li>Ensure your password meets all the conditions in the pop-up, then tap "Create Account".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-setting-up-a-crypto-exchange-account-4.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Enter the security verification code sent to your email address and tap "Submit".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-setting-up-a-crypto-exchange-account-5.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>The account has been created but you cannot use it until you verify your identity, so tap "Verify now". 

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-setting-up-a-crypto-exchange-account-6.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Select your country and ID type, and click "Continue".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-setting-up-a-crypto-exchange-account-7.jpg"}
::

<div class="alert alert-warning fs-6" role="alert">
  Verifying a Bitget account can take up to 24 hours. You will receive an email notification if your account has been successfully verified.
</div>

</li>

<li>You can now freely use your crypto exchange account. 🎉

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-1-setting-up-a-crypto-exchange-account-7.jpg"}
::

</li>

</ol>

<div class="alert alert-success px-4 mt-4" role="alert">

<h3><span class="text-success">Protecting your wallet and exchange account</span></h3>

Follow these guidelines to significantly improve the security of your crypto wallets and exchange accounts:

<ul>
<li>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).

::GuideModal{id="protect-1" title="Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)" body="This adds extra security by requiring a code to be sent to or generated by an authenticator app on your phone before you can access your wallet or exchange account. Would-be attackers would need to know both your password and have access to your phone in order to break into your account."}

</li>

<li>Ensure you have backups of your wallet's recovery phrase stored securely offline.

::GuideModal{id="protect-3" title="Ensure you have backups of your wallet's recovery phrase stored securely offline" body="One helpful thing about Web3 wallets is that they are not tied to a device. If you have access to your recovery phrase, you can recover your funds in case of device loss or failure. This also means <i>anyone</i> can get access to your funds if they have your recovery phrase. Do not store your phrase in an email draft, Google document, or anywhere else where someone might be able to see it!"}

</li>

<li>Be cautious of phishing attempts to steal your private keys or login details.

::GuideModal{id="protect-2" title="Be cautious of phishing attempts to steal your private keys or login details" body="Because anyone with your recovery phrase can access your funds, it has become the target of cyberattacks. Be very careful with links and documents you receive by email/mobile, especially if you aren't expecting them. Never <strong>under any circumstances</strong> enter your recovery phrase on a website. This is an attempt to steal your funds. Legitimate services will never ask for your recovery phrase."}

</li>

<li>Regularly update your wallet software and OS.

::GuideModal{id="protect-4" title="Regularly update your wallet software and OS" body="Be sure to install updates when they become available to avoid "}

</li>

</ul>

</div>

## Step 2 - Buying your first cryptocurrency

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    <p><strong>Using your Bitget account, you’ll do three things in this step:</strong></p>
    <ol class="m-0">
    <li>Buy cryptocurrency with fiat currency (NGN)</li>
    <li>Buy gas tokens</li>
    <li class="mb-0">Transfer the gas tokens to your Web3 wallet </li>
    </ol>
</div>

### Buying cryptocurrency with fiat

Also known as "on-ramping", converting some fiat to crypto is necessary for transacting "on-chain".

<ol>

<li>Open the Bitget App and tap the "Add funds" button at the top right corner.

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-from-fiat-to-crypto-1.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Our focus is on the "Buy Crypto with" section. Select the "Third-party payment" option.

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-from-fiat-to-crypto-2.jpg"}
::

</li>

</li>

<li>Enter a small amount in the "Pay" box, say 7,000 NGN. Select "USDT" from the "Receive" dropdown. Make sure "AlchemyPay" is selected under "Choose a third party". Click "Buy USDT."

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-from-fiat-to-crypto-3.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Check the "I have read and agreed to the above terms" box and tap "Confirm". You will be redirected to AlchemyPay to complete the transaction.

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-from-fiat-to-crypto-4.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Fill in the required information and tap "Confirm payment".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-from-fiat-to-crypto-5.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>A local bank account will be provided tha you can transfer to. Make the transfer and then click "I have completed the payment". 

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-from-fiat-to-crypto-6.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Wait for the transaction to be processed by AlchemyPay. 

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-from-fiat-to-crypto-7.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Once AlchemyPay confirms the transaction, the transaction status will change from "Processing" to "Completed". 

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-from-fiat-to-crypto-8.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>You should receive an email confirmation from AlchemyPay.


::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-from-fiat-to-crypto-9.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>You’ll also receive a deposit confirmation mail from Bitget.


::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-from-fiat-to-crypto-10.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Congratulations, you have successfully purchased your first cryptocurrency!</li>

</ol>

### Buy some gas tokens

Gas is what you pay to transact on a blockchain network. It's typically paid in the network's native cryptocurrency and its price can vary. We will buy some gas tokens for the Optimism network. 


<ol>

<li>If not already open, open the Bitget App and tap the "Trade" button at the bottom middle.

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-between-cryptocurrencies-1.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Click "Convert" on the next screen. Select "USDT" in the "From" field and enter a small amount, say 1 USDT. Select "OP" in the "To" field, then tap "Get quote".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-between-cryptocurrencies-2.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>You'll see the exchange rate for the cryptocurrencies you're swapping and the associated fees. Tap "Confirm".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-between-cryptocurrencies-3.jpg"}
::

<div class="alert alert-warning fs-6" role="alert">
  There are no swap fees transactions on Bitget, but other platforms may charge you. 
</div>

</li>

<li>Voila! You have swapped USDT for OP, the gas token for the Optimism blockchain.

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-converting-between-cryptocurrencies-4.jpg"}
::

</li>

</ol>

### Transferring cryptocurrency to your Web3 wallet

Finally, the begin transacting on the blockchain, you will transfer those OP tokens to your Rainbow Web3 wallet.

<ol> 

<li>With the Bitget app open, tap "Assets" at the bottom navigation bar and then "Spot" along the top. You should see your OP tokens there.

</div>

</li>

<li>Back in the Bitget app, paste the address in the "Withdrawal address" field, tap "All" in the "Withdrawal amount" field, then tap "Withdraw".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-withdrawing-to-wallet-7.jpg"}
::

<div class="alert alert-warning fs-6" role="alert">

</div>

</li>

<li>Review the details of your withdrawal and then tap confirm.

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-withdrawing-to-wallet-8.jpg"}
::

<div class="alert alert-danger fs-6" role="alert">
   Ensure that the "Address" shown on the confirm screen is the same as your Rainbow Web3 wallet address.
</div>

</li>

<li>Verification codes will be sent to your email and mobile number. Enter them in the respective boxes.

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-2-withdrawing-to-wallet-9.jpg"}

</div>

<li>You are now ready to transact on the blockchain!</li>

### Writing a project update

Project updates help keep donors aware of your activities. You don't need to add them immediately after creating or verifying your project, but it's something to keep in mind after about a month on Giveth.

<ol> 

<li>Open your Rainbow wallet, go to the browser, and navigate to giveth.io.</li>

<li>Tap the profile icon at the top right.

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-3-updating-your-project-1.jpg"}
::

<div class="alert alert-warning fs-6" role="alert">
  If you don't see the profile icon, you will need to sign into Giveth again. 
</div>

</li>

<li>Tap "My Projects".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-3-updating-your-project-2.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Tap "Actions".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-3-updating-your-project-3.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Tap "Add Update".

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-3-updating-your-project-4.jpg"}
::

</li>

<li>Write your update.

::Slideover{imgUrl="/images/step-3-updating-your-project-5.jpg"}
::

<div class="alert alert-warning fs-6" role="alert">
  It could be an initiative successfully executed or a milestone to be accomplished. 
</div>

</li>

<li>Tap the "Submit" button to publish your update.</li>

<li>And Voila! There’s an update for our test project on the 21st of August.

<h3><span class="text-success">Positioning your project to attract donations</span></h3>

Here are some things you can do to maximise your experience with Giveth:

<ul>

<li>Share your Giveth project page with your community and potential donors.

::GuideModal{id="giveth-1" title="Share your Giveth project page with your community and potential donors" body="The more people that have access to your Giveth project page, the higher the chances of receiving donations. This is especially true during the quadratic funding rounds that Giveth runs periodically."}

</li>

<li>Verified projects have more chances of receiving donations than unverified projects.

::GuideModal{id="giveth-2" title="Verified projects have more chances of receiving donations than unverified projects" body="Verifying your project increases your chances of participating in Giveth's quadratic funding (QF) rounds. Additionally, verifying your project unlocks earning opportunities for donors, allowing them to earn GIV tokens during the recurring two-week GIVback rounds."}

</li>

<li>Giveth can disqualify your project from participating in the GIVback program.

::GuideModal{id="giveth-3" title="Giveth can disqualify your project from participating in the GIVback program" body="Do not offer donors any incentives or rewards in exchange for their donations to your project. Do not send donated funds to others to re-donate to your project to receive GIVbacks. If your project is flagged for disqualification twice, donors will no longer be eligible to receive GIVbacks for contributing to your project."}

</li>

<li>Giveth can revoke your project’s ‘Verified’ status.

::GuideModal{id="giveth-4" title="Giveth can revoke your project’s ‘Verified’ status" body="Do not violate Giveth's terms and conditions. Doing so will result in the revocation of your project's verified badge and removal from Giveth. Ensure that all funds are used only for the activities described on your project page or your project verification application."}

</li>

<li>Always keep your project page updated.

::GuideModal{id="giveth-5" title="Always update your project page" body="Providing updates on your NGO's activities is a great way to build its credibility. The more authentic a project is, the more donations it attracts."}

## Step 4 - Finding Web3 grant opportunities

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    <p><strong>In this step, you will:</strong></p>
    <ol class="m-0">
    <li>Learn how to interact with the Web3 community</li>
    <li class="mb-0">Find out where you can look for Web3 grant opportunities</li>
    </ol>
</div>

### Interacting with the Web3 community

Before we look for Web3 grant opportunities, it's important to first get involved in the Web3 community. Getting Web3 grant funding very much depends on how involved you are in the community and how well-known your project is. 

<ul>
<li>Participate in X Spaces focused on Web3 for climate and social impact.

::GuideModal{id="interact-1" title="Participate in X spaces focused on Web3 for ecological and social impact" body="Whenever possible, join the <a href='https://x.com/LetsGROWdao'>Lets GROW</a>, <a href='https://x.com/PublicNouns'>Public Nouns</a>, and <a href='https://x.com/climate_program'>Climate Coordination Network</a> spaces. There's also <a href='https://x.com/civilmonkey/status/1813207234983133522'>this list</a> of impact-aligned Spaces you can check out. You don't have to speak, but it's a helpful way to get comfortable with the community."}

</li>

<li>Engage with X accounts doing work similar to your NGO.

::GuideModal{id="interact-2" title="Engage with X accounts doing work similar to your NGO" body="This means reacting, commenting, and/or reposting posts by projects and thought leaders of interest. Comments should always be meaningful to the information communicated. We have compiled a <a href='https://x.com/i/lists/1818142121741766830'>list of Web3 impact accounts</a> that you can use a starting point."}

</li>

<li>Listen to relevant podcasts.

::GuideModal{id="interact-3" title="Listen to relevant podcasts" body="Some good examples include <a href='https://open.spotify.com/show/5RTHF6JVgQL1cgaVfvi7cv'>ReFi Podcast</a>, <a href='https://open.spotify.com/show/32CPn7AWJLfB58O1VcOGPm'>Crypto Altruism</a>, <a href='https://open.spotify.com/show/5iaDUE5UvIKYpUZaaRrDZW'>ReFi Generation</a>, <a href='https://open.spotify.com/show/3yS1Y61r0XkogChx12JQ2q'>Crypto Sapiens</a>, and <a href='https://open.spotify.com/show/3geORcile9E1EyPyFiAHhM'>The Blockchain Socialist</a>."}

</li>

<li>Peruse CARBON Copy's Web3 impact <a href='/projects/' target='_blank'>project database</a> to find potential partners.

::GuideModal{id="interact-4" title="Peruse CARBON Copy's Web3 impact project databases to find potential partners" body="We have curated <a href='/projects/'>a database</a> of over 250 Web3 projects making ecological and social impact. Each project has its own profile page where you can find additional details and contact information."}

</li>

</ul>

### Looking for Web3 grant opportunities

<ul>
<li>Subscribe to Web3 impact copies.

::GuideModal{id="funding-1" title="Subscribe to Web3 impact copies" body="These usually come packed with happenings in the Web3 impact community and opportunities to key into. Examples include Web3forGood's <a href='https://web3forgood.substack.com/'>weekly newsletter</a> and <a href='https://x.com/karmahq_'>Karma GAP's</a> Weekly Grant Roundup post on X. You can also subscribe to CARBON Copy's <a href='https://paragraph.xyz/@carboncopy'>weekly newsletter</a> for updates."}

</li>

<li>Follow the right accounts on X.

::GuideModal{id="funding-2" title="Follow the right accounts on X" body="I've created a <a href='https://x.com/i/lists/1824774234456920191'>list of accounts</a> that frequently share updates about ecological and social impact funding opportunities. Engage with them if you can because doing so will tweak your algorithm to regularly bring funding opportunities to your feed."}

</li>

<li>Check the Gitcoin Grant <a href='https://explorer.gitcoin.co/' target='_blank'>explorer</a>.

::GuideModal{id="funding-5" title="Check the Gitcoin Grant explorer" body="Gitcoin Grants is the most popular Web3 grant platform (more on it further down). You can check it periodically to see if any new grant programs become available."}

</li>

<li>Create your own opportunities.

::GuideModal{id="funding-3" title="Create your own opportunities" body="Grants aren’t the only way to execute initiatives. For example, The Solar Foundation teamed up with Helper Social Development Foundation (NGO) in Enugu to provide solar power for the school they're building for economically disadvantaged children. Your efforts may only yield success if you build a relationship with these projects through regular interactions."}

</li>

<li>Join the 9ja Web3 Grant Initiative on Telegram.

::GuideModal{id="funding-4" title="Join the 9ja Web3 Grant Initiative on Telegram" body="I've started a community specifically for Nigeria NGOs looking for Web3 funding opportunities. We're starting on Telegram. You can join through this link and introduce yourself."}

</ul>

<div class="alert alert-success px-4 mt-4" role="alert">

<h3><span class="text-success">Understanding the reality of Web3 grants</span></h3>

Here are a few things that are helpful to know about Web3 grants:

<ul>

<li>Web3 grant programs often require projects that have some Web3 component

::GuideModal{id="grant-1" title="Web3 grant programs often require projects that have some Web3 component" body="There are a few exceptions but most of the grant money is available for projects implementing Web3 solutions."}

</li>

<li>One of the most effective ways to include Web3 in your NGO work is to educate your community on Web3.

::GuideModal{id="grant-2" title="One of the most effective ways to include Web3 in your NGO work is to educate your community on Web3" body="It may sound challenging at first, but once you become comfortable in Web3 you'll be able to help others make the transition as well. This can significantly increase your eligibility for Web3 grant funding."}

</li>

<li>It may take a few tries to get accepted into a grant round.

::GuideModal{id="grant-3" title="It may take a few tries to get accepted into a grant round" body="Success may not come at once. For example, it may take one or two tries before you get accepted into a Web3 grant program. Don't despair. Continue making impact and engaging with the Web3 community."}

</li>

<li>Gitcoin Grants is the most likely source of Web3 grant funding.

::GuideModal{id="grant-4" title="Gitcoin Grants is the most likely source of Web3 grant funding" body="They host grant funding rounds focused on things like climate solutions, education, and community development. They aren't very frequent, however."}

## Step 5 - Setting up a Gitcoin project

<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
    <p><strong>In this step, you will do two things:</strong></p>
    <ol class="m-0">
    <li>Create a project page for your NGO on Web3 grant platform Gitcoin</li>

</ol>

<div class="alert alert-success px-4 mt-4" role="alert">

<h3><span class="text-success">Understanding Gitcoin Grants</span></h3>

Gitcoin Grants (GG) was designed by Gitcoin to support and sustain public goods. Here is what you need to know about it:

<ul>

<li>GG rounds are available all the time but the biggest collection of fundraising rounds happen quarterly.

::GuideModal{id="gitcoin-1" title="GG rounds are available all the time but the biggest collection of fundraising rounds happen quarterly" body="Because GG is a platform, any operator can create a grant round at any time. Gitcoin itself organises four big events each year with hundreds of thousands of dollars in grant funding available across various rounds. These events are the ones paying closest attention to."}

</li>

<li>GG rounds are usually tailored to a particular type or location of project.

::GuideModal{id="gitcoin-2" title="GG rounds are usually tailored to a particular type or location of project" body="The Climate Solutions round operated by Climate Coordination Network, for instance, requires projects to be focused on climate impact. You can apply if your project focuses on the climate or you can tailor your proposal to include the climate-related aspects of your NGO. For example, the 9ja Web3 Grant Initiative could apply for funding to support a health-based NGO aiming to plant trees in all medical centres within a specific area."}

</li>

<li>GG rounds prioritise number of contributors over total amount raised.

::GuideModal{id="gitcoin-3" title="GG rounds prioritise number of contributors over total amount raised" body="The amount of funding a project receives at the end of the round is primarily influenced by the number of unique donors. Projects with 50 unique donors, for example, will receive more than those with only 20, even if the latter project receives a greater amount of donations. Authenticity and popularity are crucial for the success of your NGO's fundraising efforts."}

</li>

</ul>

</div>

## Next Steps

As I mentioned, this is not an exhaustive guide on web3 for non-profits. Let’s look at other things you could leverage to stand out:

<ul>

<li>Keep an eye out for Web3 grant opportunities.

::GuideModal{id="nextsteps-1" title="Keep an eye out for Web3 grant opportunities" body="Follow the advice in Step 4 to stay up to date with opportunities."}

</li>

<li>Report your activities.

::GuideModal{id="nextsteps-2" title="Report your activities" body="The focus should be on well-documented activity reports that include data on accomplishments rather than just announcing successes. You could even enhance this with video reporting."}

</li>

<li>Learn about Web3.

::GuideModal{id="nextsteps-7" title="Learn about Web3" body="Ensure you equip yourself with basic knowledge of the technology and its philosophy. Without this knowledge, you may not be able to capitalise on some opportunities. "}

</li>

<li>Market your NGO.

::GuideModal{id="nextsteps-3" title="Market your NGO" body="Although this isn't a profit-driven venture, marketing helps you reach a wider audience. You can learn and refine this skill to benefit your NGO."}

</li>

<li>Track your expenses.

::GuideModal{id="nextsteps-4" title="Track your expenses" body="The goal is to sharpen your accounting skills to maintain accurate records of the funds coming into the NGO. Remember that these are voluntary donations, not the NGO's money, so you are responsible for regularly updating donors on how the funds are used."}

</li>

<li>Get big on collaborations.

::GuideModal{id="nextsteps-5" title="Get big on collaborations" body="Web3 impact builders are everywhere. Show genuine interest in their work and engage with what they’re doing. They’ll be more likely to support your work."}

</li>

<li>Join the 9ja Web3 Grant Initiative on Telegram!
