As the Writers Guild of America (WGA) continues its labour dispute with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), Regenerative finance (ReFi) and its underlying philosophy provides clues as to how we might prevent future disputes from interrupting our beloved pastime.   

If the strike has taught us anything, it's that writers, along with most everyone else involved in the creation of movies and television series, are seen by production studios as a resource to be extracted. The logic of our economic system, once applied, compels these studios to keep extraction costs to a minimum as a way of maximising profits. When that gap becomes large enough, when the perceived inequity becomes so egregious, the only viable means to claw back some of the lost value is strike action.

While this ebb and flow may seem like a healthy process, it paints a rather bleak picture of our economic system. To illustrate, we have  a large, ever-increasing pie with an ever-increasing number of mouths to feed. The people in control of the pie server (the studios), however, are playing a zero-sum game. They want as much of the pie for themselves as they can get.

Regenerative economics, with its society-first approach, has a completely different take on the pie


<h2 class="mb-3 mt-4">But first, why are they striking?</h2>

It was Don Ohlmeyer who sagely pointed out that the answer to all of our questions could be traced back to the single-most important asset in our current economic system: money. In this case, residuals from streaming revenue. 

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-4">A question of value</h2>

I think we can all agree that society is better off with movies and television series.
