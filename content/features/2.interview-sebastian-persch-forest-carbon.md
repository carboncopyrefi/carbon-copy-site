The CARBON Copy (CC) team had a chance to sit down with Sebastian Persch, a forest scientist for reforestation project developer [Forest Carbon](https://forestcarbon.com), to discuss Web3's potential in the carbon credit space, the phenomenon of carbon tunnel vision, and what the future outlook is for regenerative finance.

**CC:** *Great to have you with us, Sebastian.*

**Sebastian:** Happy to be here and excited by the work you're doing. We need more of a spotlight on the space.

**CC:** *We appreciate that. First off, we'd like to get a sense of how you got into forest science in the first place. Did you know at a young age or get into it later?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *That's interesting. How did you come across Forest Carbon?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *And how would you describe Forest Carbon? What is it trying to achieve in terms of climate impact?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *Where are you at in terms of Web3's potential impact on your work? Are you bullish or bearish?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *How far along are we in terms of actual implementation of these ideas? Are there any projects you can point to as examples?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *But there's still the issue of certification, is there not? Like, minting or bridging credits on-chain is an important step, but isn't much of the centralisation in the industry at the point of certification?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *Perhaps it would be better to back up a step. How exactly does the carbon credit certification process work?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *Okay, so you have these big companies acting as gatekeepers, but this has a kind of positive effect because we need to make sure the carbon credits being minted are actually sequestering carbon. Is the democratisation of carbon credit issuance a good idea? Or, more specifically, what needs to be done so that democratisation doesn't result in a bunch of junk credits and scams?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *There's such a thing in the climate impact space called "carbon tunnel vision". The idea is that we are focusing much of our energy on reducing carbon emissions without considering other elements such as biodiversity. Is this a real concern in your mind?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *Are there any alternative "credit-based" methodologies out there looking at criteria other than carbon sequestration?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *For that matter, is the credit system a good way to incentivise climate action?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *Where does the average person fit into this? Do they have access to these credits?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *Before we go, we wanted to get your thoughts on regenerative finance (ReFi). How do you see ReFi evolving over the next decade or so? Is mainstream adoption a real possibility?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *Last one. Any thoughts you'd like to leave our readers with?*

**Sebastian:**

**CC:** *Thanks for taking the time to speak with us, Sebastian. We wish you the best of luck to you and Forest Carbon in the fight against climate change.*
