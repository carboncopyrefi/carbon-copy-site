# {{ title }}

**CARBON Copy is the preeminent source of ReFi news, information, and analysis.**

We fill the information void in the regenerative finance (ReFi) space. We provide a combination of news, education, expert analysis, industry reports, and project evaluation to help our readers better understand the space and get projects more exposure.

At the same time, we're also building the most comprehensive library of ReFi projects that acts as the foundation of our proprietary analytical framework for understanding impact.

<h2 class="mb-3 mt-4">A Quantitative Framework for Climate Projects</h2>

Working with sustainability experts and climate researchers, we built a framework for analysing and scoring ReFi projects. We evaluate impact, feasibility, timeline, cost and potential return using an array of criteria, including:

- Soil health
- Biodiversity
- Carbon sequestration
- Community development
- Revenue potential
- Flora and fauna
- Alignment with UN development goals

**We want to *prove* demonstrable impact, not just talk about it.**
